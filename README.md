# Marketing-Elisabeth

This project is a marketing site. It is the UI for an app called Restaurant Passport, which allows the user to create a collection of restaurants. The user is able to log in to the app from the marketing site. Then they are able to select a city and explore various restaurants. They are able to save (stamp) restaurants, rate and delete. 
The user is also able to see the team that built the project. 
The user is able to input information on contact page, but this information is not being stored and will probably not be seen. 

This project is linked to a github repository that includes all contributers to the project.
